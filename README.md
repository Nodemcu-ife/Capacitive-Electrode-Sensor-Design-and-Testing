# Capacitive-Electrode-Sensor-Design-and-Testing
The design and development of the capacitive water level sensor is showcased in this project. The functional programming code that enables the Arduino microprocessor to work with this sensor is included in this repository. The testing is done and it is found that water level at each finger electrodes of the water level sensor is attached to a wire hich is connected to a digital pin of the Arduino. The analog readings measured from the finger electrodes are then calibrated for ease of computation in the microcontroller.
